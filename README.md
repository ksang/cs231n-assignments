### Overview

This project are assignment solutions and practices of Stanford class CS231n.

The assignments are for 2017 years' version because video recordings are available on youtube.

For detailed information of the class, goto: [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/)
