Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition assignments and practices

### Overview

This project are assignment solutions and practices of Stanford class CS231n.

The assignments are for 2017 years' version because video recordings are available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv).

For detailed information of the class, goto: [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/)

### Index

- There are totally three collections of assignments, they are located in three directories.
- The assignments are updated with my solutions (WIP).
- Deep learning framework related assignments are finished with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
- For original quiz, follow instructions from each assignment readme documentation.

[Assignment 1](/assignment1)

In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier.

[Assignment 2](/assignment2)

In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training
Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.

[Assignment 3](/assignment3)

In this assignment you will implement recurrent networks, and apply them to image captioning on Microsoft COCO. You will also explore methods for visualizing the features of a pretrained model on ImageNet, and also this model to implement Style Transfer. Finally, you will train a generative adversarial network to generate images that look like a training dataset!
